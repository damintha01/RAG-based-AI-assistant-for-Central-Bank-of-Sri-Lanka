implement long overdue \\nstructural reforms to address legacy issues and revive the export sector.02\\nEnhancing services exports through exploiting their untapped potential in a productive manner \\nremains a key strategy for improving Sri Lanka’s external current account outcome.03\\nInnovative strategies to entice both international and domestic tourists are necessary to keep the \\ntourism sector functioning in the new normal that has been created by the pandemic.04\\nThe Colombo Port City, the first of its kind in South Asia, is expected to bring numerous \\nsocioeconomic benefits to the country, conditional on the country’s ability to attract strategic \\ninvestments by offering an investor friendly atmosphere expeditiously.05\\n52\\nIssues and Policies…\\nThe country’s continued failure to attract sizeable FDIs highlights the structural, institutional and \\npolicy impediments that need to be addressed urgently, while maintaining a consistent policy \\nframework with a long term view.06\\nImproving the external current account balance and the fiscal balance is necessary to continue \\nreversing the expansion in external debt, in order to ensure macroeconomic stability and prevent \\ndisruptions to long term economic growth.07\\nMajor fiscal challenges that need to be addressed by the Government include the persistently low \\nrevenue, rigid recurrent expenditure, rising gross financing needs and the resultant elevated debt \\nlevel, as well as the need to improve the financial performance of SOBEs.08\\nPolicy adjustments in the period ahead must give due consideration to the fact that the COVID-19 \\npandemic has had a disproportionate impact on underprivileged segments of the population and has \\naggravated inequalities, not only related to income, but also in relation to other aspects that affect \\nsocioeconomic wellbeing in the short run and productivity in the long run.\\n09\\n53\\nIssues and Policies…\\nIncreasing food self sufficiency in

a resilient \\nand dynamic labour force that can contribute to the country’s transition to a high income economy.11\\nThere is widespread recognition that MSMEs are vital for the generation of inclusive and sustainable \\ngrowth, highlighting the need to devise unique policy interventions to uplift this segment.12\\nThe financial sector of Sri Lanka needs to evolve fast to cater to the emerging needs of the economy \\nin the prevailing low inflation, low interest rate environment.13\\n54\\nIssues and Policies…\\nAs the country’s interest rate structure is expected to remain in single digit levels, the general public \\nneeds to be more vigilant of offers and opportunities promoted by various unscrupulous parties.14\\nAlthough the usage of digital payment methods accelerated
